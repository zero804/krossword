How To Build KrossWordPuzzle
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

--- On Unix:

> cd <project_name_path>
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..      <- do not forget the ..
> make

and then:
> sudo make install      or
> su -c 'make install'


Run "kbuildsycoca4" to get mime types (*.puz, *.kwp) recognized.


to uninstall the project:
> sudo make uninstall       or
> su -c 'make uninstall'


--- On Windows: (not tested, anyone want to test it?)

> cd <project_name_path>
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%KDEDIRS% ..      <- do not forget the ..
> make
> make install

where %KDEDIRS% points to your KDE installation prefix.

to uninstall the project:
> make uninstall

Note: use nmake if you're building with the Visual Studio compiler, or make
if you're using the minGW compiler
