Krossword
====================
A crossword puzzle game and editor.
It's based on [KrossWordPuzzle][1] by Friedrich PÃ¼lz because the development had stopped and the original author was unreacheable.

Since version 0.18.3 alpha 4 it's ported to Qt5/KF5, but consider it as a preview requiring still a lot of work.

General aims of the project:
 - maintain and simplify the codebase;
 - improve the user experience.

See the Changelog for more details.
