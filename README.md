Krossword
====================
A crossword puzzle game and editor for KDE.
It's based on [KrossWordPuzzle][1] by Friedrich PÃ¼lz. The development has stopped since many years and the original author is unreacheable (various attempts to contact him).

General aims of the project:

 - maintain and simplify the codebase
 - improve the user experience

See the Changelog for more details.
