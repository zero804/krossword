Krossword
====================
A crossword puzzle game and editor for KDE.
It's based on [KrossWordPuzzle][1] by Friedrich PÃ¼lz. The development has stopped since many years and the original author is unreacheable (various attempts to contact him).
For these reasons we decided to try to bring it back.

General aims of the project:

 - maintain the codebase (now it compiles again!)
 - simplify the code where possible aiming to port it to Qt5/KDE Frameworks 5
 - improve the user experience

See the Changelog for more details.
