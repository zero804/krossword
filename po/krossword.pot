"answers in the second row.\n"
"Another tradition in puzzle design (in North America and Britain "
"particularly) is that the grid should have 180-degree rotational symmetry, "
"so that its pattern appears the same if the paper is turned upside down. "
"Most puzzle designs also require that all white cells be orthogonally "
